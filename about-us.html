                    <p>
                        Hygenix Seeds is the brainchild of Shri Yaganti Venkateswarlu (YVR), a visionary with over 40
                        years of expertise in the seed industry.
                        His extensive experience, particularly in developing field crop hybrids, has established him as
                        a leader in creating seeds that stand
                        out for their quality and performance in the market.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Known for his commitment to quality, YVR ensures that both farmers and trade partners benefit
                        from superior seeds at accessible prices.
                        The YVR Groupâ€™s vast network of 1,800 distributors and dealers across the country is a testament
                        to the trust and respect the brand has earned.
